# Todos

This project is a React project on a Meteor backend written in ES6/JS. It is a fairly simple todo list app, with basic features like adding todo list items,  checking/unchecking todo list items, deleting/undeleting todo list items, and searching. The todo list automatically sorts incomplete items by most recently created, and sorts completed items by most recently completed (though these sorts can conveniently be temporarily overridden by dragging around the todo list items).



## How to Run

To run the project, you must have meteor installed on your local machine. This is as simple as running the following command in a Mac or Linux terminal:

`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

The project can then be started on a local server using the following command:

`meteor run`

**For convenience, this todo list app has also been hosted on [react-todo-project.meteor.com](http://react-todo-project.meteor.com).**
